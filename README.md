# URL Shortener Service

The URL Shortener contains a set of functions aimed at converting long URLs into shorter versions and storing them in a database.

## Database Configuration

To ensure seamless functionality, it is essential to replace the placeholder database details with your actual database credentials.

## Usage

The `index.php` file serves as the main entry point for handling requests for shortened URLs. Upon receiving a request, the script redirects the user to the corresponding long URL. If the request is empty, the script directs the user to the default page, providing a smooth browsing experience.
